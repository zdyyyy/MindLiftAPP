Application Idea
MindLift is a mental wellness application designed to provide users a private space to express, record, and relieve their mental stress. In this application, users will have the opportunity to immerse themselves in a completely relaxing atmosphere according to their pace. Coming with 4 totally pragmatic features: diary, music, map and yoga, we hope to bring a dareful wish where users are able to eventually reach their inner peace, thus lifting their mind in a sense. Below, we will showcase our UI designs and the building blocks of the application.
